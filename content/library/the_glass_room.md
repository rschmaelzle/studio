We are building gods in black boxes.

The neural networks we train are vast, multidimensional landscapes of weights and biases. We pour data in one side—text, images, the sum total of human expression—and answers come out the other. But the middle? The middle is a fog.

If we are to live with these entities, we need to build glass rooms. We need to be able to see the machinery working. Not just the output, but the process. 

This is not a technical problem; it is a narrative one. We need new metaphors to describe how these systems "think." We need to move beyond "brain" comparisons and start talking about "high-dimensional cartography."
