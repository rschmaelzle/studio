<span class="drop-cap">T</span>he "Greek Row" on Deck 6 didn’t smell like the ocean. It smelled of Axe body spray, stale keg beer, and high-voltage regret.

I was there on a Tuesday night—which the ship’s calendar insisted was "Fiesta Friday"—because a kid named Brad-Chad (I think his parents couldn't decide, so they hyphenated it) had slid a fat envelope of Dining Hall Credits under my office door.

"He just vanished, Professor," Brad-Chad said. He was wearing a toga made of smart-fabric that shimmered in neon blue. He looked like a Greek statue that had been 3D-printed on a low-resolution setting.

"People vanish on this ship all the time, kid," I said, lighting a cigarette. The smoke curled up toward the 'No Smoking' hologram, which flickered indignantly. "Usually they wake up three days later in the brig or married to a blackjack dealer on the Lido Deck."

"Not Tripp," Brad-Chad insisted. "Tripp is a legacy. *Sigma Tau Omega*. His dad owns the patent for the neural-implant they use to teach Calculus. Tripp was... stressed. He was talking about the 'Hazing Rituals.' He said they were going too far. He said he was going to the Dean."

"The 'Paddle of Knowledge' getting too heavy?"

"Worse. He said he was going to expose the Brotherhood. Then, poof. Gone. His bunk is empty. His neural-link is offline."

I took the job. Mostly because I needed the credits to bribe the laundry droid to stop shrinking my tweed jackets.

<div class="scene-break">❖</div>

Sigma Tau Omega occupied the prime real estate near the aft infinity pool. The music was a bass-heavy thrum that vibrated the fillings in my teeth. I flashed my faculty ID at the bouncer—a Cyborg on a football scholarship—and stepped inside.

The main hall was a chaotic mix of ancient Rome and a cyberpunk rave. Students were doing keg stands with bioluminescent beer that glowed green in their stomachs. A banner overhead read: *“Socrates Died for This Party.”*

I found Tripp’s room. It was surprisingly neat. A bunk bed, a poster of a vintage 2020 Tesla, and a desk piled high with protein powder tubs.

I started digging.

The narrative was easy to build. Kid gets a conscience, threatens to blow the whistle on some sadistic hazing ritual involving electric eels in the pool, and the brothers silence him. It was the oldest story in the book.

But it didn't fit.

I found Tripp’s personal tablet taped to the underside of a drawer. It wasn't encrypted with a standard frat-boy password like "BOOBZ123." It had military-grade encryption.

Luckily, I teach History. And history teaches you that people are lazy. I checked the sticky note under his pillow. *Password: 123456.*

I opened the files.

There were no videos of hazing. There were spreadsheets. Shipping manifests. Transfer logs.

Tripp wasn't investigating the fraternity. He was investigating the University Administration.

I scrolled through the data. The *SS Alma Mater* had a "Study Abroad Exchange Program." It sounded prestigious. But according to Tripp’s data, the students selected for the "Exchange" were all underperforming legacies with high-net-worth parents who had stopped donating.

The destination for the exchange? The *Vladivostok-Alaska Poly-Tech Icebreaker*.

The "Exchange Rate"? One failing student in return for three tons of enriched uranium fuel for the ship’s reactor.

"Mother of God," I muttered. "They’re trading frat boys for nuclear fuel."

<div class="scene-break">❖</div>

I heard the door click behind me.

I turned around. Standing there was Dean Snively, the Dean of Student "Wellness." He was a small man who wore a suit that cost more than my annual salary. Flanking him were two Proctors—campus security goons with tasers and noise-canceling headsets.

"Professor Harlow," Snively smiled, showing teeth that were perfectly capped and entirely fake. "I see you’re conducting an unauthorized tutorial."

"Just grading some extra credit, Snively," I said, holding up the tablet. "Did you know Tripp found out you're selling the D-minus students to the Russians?"

Snively sighed, checking his smartwatch. "It’s not 'selling,' Ray. It’s an asset liquidation of underperforming stock. The Russians need manual labor for their ice-shield generators. We need reactor fuel to keep the AC running on the party deck. It’s Synergy."

"Where is he?"

"Tripp? He’s in the Loading Bay on Deck 1. Being crated up. The transfer shuttle arrives in twenty minutes." Snively nodded to the Proctors. "Escort the Professor to the brig. Charge him with... let's say, 'Academic Dishonesty.'"

The Proctors moved in.

I grabbed the nearest heavy object—a five-pound tub of 'Mega-Mass' protein powder—and chucked it. It hit the first Proctor in the face, exploding into a cloud of vanilla-scented dust.

While they coughed, blinded by the fog of synthetic gains, I bolted for the window.

We were on Deck 6. The pool was below on Deck 5.

"I hate this job," I yelled, and jumped.

<div class="scene-break">❖</div>

I hit the pool with a splash that ruined my fedora. I scrambled out, dodging a confused water-polo team, and sprinted for the service elevator.

The Loading Bay on Deck 1 smelled of diesel and cold steel. It was the part of the ship they didn't show in the brochures.

I saw it. A shipping container marked *“Textbooks – Fragile.”* It was sitting on the mag-lev rail, ready to be shot out to the waiting Russian drone-barge.

I pulled the emergency brake on the rail. The container screeched to a halt, sparking wildly.

I banged on the side. "Tripp! You in there?"

"Let me out!" a muffled voice screamed. "I have a seminar on 'Intro to Hedonism' in ten minutes!"

"Professor Harlow!" Snively’s voice boomed over the PA system. "Step away from the cargo. Or I will revoke your pension."

I looked up at the security camera. I held up Tripp’s tablet.

"I’ve got the manifests, Snively!" I shouted. "And I just set them to auto-upload to the parents' alumni newsletter! You think Tripp's dad is going to donate that new library wing if he finds out you traded his son for a bucket of plutonium?"

Silence on the PA.

The ship’s engines hummed. The Russian drone-barge hovered outside the airlock, impatient.

Finally, Snively’s voice came back, strained. "What do you want, Harlow?"

"Open the crate. Tripp goes back to his dorm. And you grant him full amnesty for the semester."

"Fine," Snively spat. "But the upload?"

"I'll delete it. After I see the kid walk free."

<div class="scene-break">❖</div>

Tripp was shaken, but alive. He hugged me, which was awkward, then immediately asked if this would count as 'Field Experience' credits.

"Go back to the frat house, kid," I told him. "Stick to the beer pong. Leave the investigative journalism to the people who are already dead inside."

I watched him run off toward the elevator.

I deleted the file. Well, most of it. I kept a copy on a floppy disk I kept in my shoe. You never know when you need leverage for a raise.

I walked up to the Lido Deck. The party was still raging. The neon lights reflected off the dark ocean.

I sat at the bar. Val, the bartender droid, slid a glass of whiskey toward me.

"Rough night, Professor?" Val asked, his voice synthesizer glitching slightly.

"The usual, Val," I said, taking a sip. "Just another day in higher education."

I looked out at the horizon. The Russian ship was turning away, disappearing into the mist. They’d have to find their fuel somewhere else. Or maybe they’d just wait for mid-terms.

I adjusted my wet fedora and pulled a stack of wet essays from my jacket pocket.

*“The Fall of Rome: Was it caused by too many parties?”*

"B-minus," I muttered, and drank the whiskey.
