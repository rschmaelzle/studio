The street outside my window is lined with trees that do not care about the metaverse. They drop their leaves in the fall, they stand bare in the winter, and they bloom when the light returns. They are the original evergreen technology.

I sit here, typing into a glowing rectangle, constructing a "Studio" that exists nowhere and everywhere. It is a strange duality. 

My professional life is measured in citations and p-values. But here, in the Studio, I am measuring in something else. Latency? Narrative arc? The texture of a pixel?

I built this space to hold the things that don't fit in a CV. The messy experiments. The stories that haven't found an ending yet. It is my digital garden, and like the trees on Evergreen Avenue, I hope it grows slowly, without asking for permission.
