<span class="drop-cap">T</span>he Caribbean sun was a hologram, but the hangover was real. It throbbed behind my eyes, a steady rhythm matching the low-frequency hum of the ship’s engines.

I was sitting in my office on Deck 12, buried under a stack of essays titled *“Why The Cold War Was Actually Just a Misunderstanding,”* trying to decide if I should fail the student or just throw myself out the porthole. My office was squeezed between the Laundry chute and the "Department of Pre-Collapse Optimism." It smelled of bleach and broken dreams.

My name is Ray Harlow. I teach 20th Century History to kids who have neural implants to do their thinking for them. But in the shadows of the *SS Alma Mater*, the flagship of the Euro-Latam Educational Conglomerate, I have a second job. I find things. I fix things. I’m the only guy on a ship of four thousand people who remembers how to use deductive logic instead of an algorithm.

The door slid open with a hiss. It was Lena, a Teaching Assistant from the Economics Department. She looked like she hadn’t slept since the semester started. She was vibrating with caffeine and terror.

"Professor Harlow?" she whispered, checking the corridor behind her for drone-cams.

"Office hours are over, Lena. If this is about your thesis on Crypto-Currency Archaeology, I’m still not reading it."

"It’s Dean Gold," she said, shutting the door and locking it. "He’s dead."

I put down my red pen. Dean Cornelius Gold, head of the Department of Profitable Economics. A man who looked like a bullfrog in a bespoke suit and possessed about as much soul.

"Dead how?" I asked. "Choked on a lobster tail? Tripped on a pile of donor money?"

"The official report says cardiac arrest," Lena said. "They found him in the VIP Sauna on Deck 1 an hour ago. The ship’s medical AI signed off on it instantly. They’re cremating him in three hours. Before the Alumni Gala."

"Efficient," I noted. "President Sterling hates bad PR during Alumni Week."

"He didn't have a heart attack, Ray. I manage his calendar. He runs five miles a day and has a heart made of Teflon. He was murdered. I know it."

She reached into her bag and pulled out a bottle. It wasn't the synthetic swill they served at the student union. It was a bottle of Lagavulin, dated 2021. Real glass. Real cork.

"Find out who did it," she said, sliding the bottle across the desk. "Before he turns to ash."

I looked at the bottle. I looked at the stack of terrible essays. "You know if the Proctors catch me investigating a 'closed case,' I lose my tenure? They’ll dump me at the next port. I hear the Azores are awful this time of year."

"Please, Ray."

I sighed and took the bottle. "Fine. But if I get caught, you’re telling the Dean of Discipline I was tutoring you on the history of single malts."

<div class="scene-break">❖</div>

The VIP Wellness Center on Deck 1 was forbidden territory for staff. It was reserved for "Platinum Donors" and "Executive Faculty." I bypassed the biometric lock by using a maintenance key I’d bribed off a janitor droid named Unit 734.

The sauna was still cordoned off, but the body was gone. The heat was stifling. It smelled of cedar, eucalyptus, and something else—something sharp and metallic that lingered at the back of my throat.

I scanned the room. No signs of struggle. The door had a heavy mechanical deadbolt. Locked from the inside. The Proctors had probably looked at that, shrugged, and called it a heart attack.

I crouched down near the heater. The floorboards were wet. Not unusual for a sauna, but the puddle was concentrated in one spot, right near the intake vent. I touched the wood. It was warped, but cold.

"Curious," I muttered.

I checked the temperature logs on the wall panel. A massive spike in humidity at 09:00 hours, followed by a rapid cooling.

Then I saw it. A tiny scrap of confetti stuck in the floor drain. It was silver, shaped like a skull. The kind they used in the Theater Department for their "edgy" productions.

I put the pieces together. The cold floor. The lack of oxygen in the room. The metallic taste. The locked door.

"Physics," I said to the empty room. "The one thing you can't bribe."

<div class="scene-break">❖</div>

I found Professor Halloway on the Lido Deck. The sun was setting, turning the fake Caribbean sky a bruised purple. The Lido pool had been converted into a stage. Halloway was directing the dress rehearsal for his magnum opus: *Hamlet on Jet-Skis.*

"More angst!" Halloway screamed into a megaphone, wearing a beret and a scarf despite the heat. "Hamlet is revving the engine of his soul! I want to feel the torque of his despair!"

Halloway was the Chair of the Arts Department. He was also the man Dean Gold had publicly threatened to defund yesterday to pay for a new Business School infinity pool.

I walked up behind him. "Nice production, Halloway. Very... splashy."

He spun around. "Harlow. You’re interrupting my vision. We open in two hours."

"I hear you had a breakthrough with your budget problem," I said, leaning against a railing. "Dean Gold isn't going to cut your funding anymore. Mostly because he's currently cooling in the ship's morgue."

Halloway didn't flinch. "Tragic. Stress is a silent killer, Ray."

"So is Carbon Dioxide," I said.

Halloway froze.

"Here's how I see it," I continued, keeping my voice low so the student actors on the jet-skis couldn't hear. "You went to the sauna before Gold arrived. You brought a present. A massive block of dry ice. Frozen CO2. You put it on the heater."

"That's absurd," Halloway scoffed.

"Is it? You use tons of the stuff for your fog machines. You slipped out, the Dean went in. He locked the door behind him. The heat sublimated the ice. The room filled with gas. It displaced the oxygen. He got sleepy, sat down, and suffocated. By the time the Proctors opened the door, the ice was gone. The weapon vanished into thin air. A perfect locked-room murder."

Halloway stared at me. The arrogance drained out of his face, replaced by the desperate look of a man who realized his tenure was up.

"He was going to cancel the Arts!" Halloway hissed. "For an *infinity pool*! It was a moral imperative, Ray! It was poetic justice!"

"It was sloppy," I corrected. "You left a piece of stage confetti in the drain."

Suddenly, the overhead speakers crackled. *“Security Alert. Unauthorized personnel on Lido Deck.”*

Two Proctor drones hovered over the pool, their red lights scanning the crowd. Then, three human security officers—beefy guys in tactical polos—came marching out of the elevator.

Halloway panicked. He looked at the jet-ski nearest to the edge of the pool.

"Don't do it, Halloway," I said.

"To be, or not to be!" he screamed, and leaped onto the jet-ski.

He gunned the engine. The jet-ski shot forward, not into the water, but straight across the wet tiles of the deck, skidding wildly toward the buffet table. He crashed into a sculpture of a swan made of butter, sending shrimp and silverware flying everywhere.

The Proctors swarmed him before he could stand up.

I stepped back into the shadows of a fake palm tree. I couldn't be seen here. If the Proctors knew I’d solved the case, President Sterling would have my badge.

I watched as they dragged a screaming Halloway away. The Security Chief was already on his radio, taking credit for the capture. "Yes, Mr. President. We apprehended the suspect. Top-notch surveillance work."

I lit a cigarette—illegal on Deck 9, but I didn't care—and walked away.

<div class="scene-break">❖</div>

Two hours later, I was back in my office.

The ship’s intercom announced that due to "unforeseen circumstances," the production of *Hamlet* would be replaced by a lecture on "Synergy in Corporate Governance."

I poured two fingers of the 2021 Lagavulin into a chipped mug. It tasted like smoke and history.

Lena had her justice. The Administration had their PR win—they’d spin it that they caught a "rogue element" instantly. And me?

I picked up the next essay on the stack.

*“The Cold War: Was it caused by a lack of social media?”*

I took a long drink of the scotch, picked up my red pen, and wrote an F so hard it tore the paper.

"Class dismissed," I said to the empty room.
