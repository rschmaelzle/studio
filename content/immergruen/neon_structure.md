**Project Status:** In Development

I am exploring how to use PyScript to generate random city layouts based on the musical rhythm of a user's voice. 

The goal is to create a "Soundscape City" where:
1.  Loud tones create skyscrapers.
2.  Silence creates parks.
3.  Rapid speech creates dense alleyways.

*Stay tuned for the WebXR demo.*
